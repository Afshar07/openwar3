// The IN-GAME Options panels — F10 → Options → Gameplay / Video / Sound — built from the game's
// own `UI\FrameDef\UI\EscMenuOptionsPanel.fdf`. The panel STACK is ui/escMenu.ts's (this file's
// three panels are four more faces of the one Esc menu); what lives here is the model behind
// them, the way src/data/options.ts is the model behind the glue screen.
//
// It is the SAME model. Every row on these panels is an `OPTION_DEFS` row, bound through the
// same `escFrame ?? frame` name and applied through the same four appliers, so a volume set
// mid-match and one set from the main menu are one setting with one store. The screen edits a
// WORKING copy and applies it live (a volume drag has to be heard, a gamma drag seen); OK
// commits it to localStorage, Cancel puts the committed values back through the same appliers,
// which makes it a complete undo.
//
// WHAT THE IN-GAME PANEL DOES NOT OFFER, and why it is not a gap. Five of the Video panel's rows
// are read-only VALUES in the game's own file — Resolution, Model Detail, Animation Quality,
// Texture Quality, Spell Detail — because changing any of them in 2003 meant resetting the D3D
// device mid-match. We print the live value into each of them exactly as the game does; the
// pulldowns that change them are on the glue screen.
//
// GAME SPEED is the one row that is not an `OPTION_DEFS` row (the glue Options screen has no
// slider for it — in the game it lives here and on the create screen): src/data/gameSpeed.ts is
// its model. In single player it is live, a drag is felt at once and OK remembers it for the
// next match; in ANY multiplayer game it is the host's pick for every machine, so the slider is
// greyed and only shows it.
