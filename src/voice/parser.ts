// Voice Control's MAPPING: what the recogniser heard → the commands a player could have clicked.
//
// Deterministic, and deliberately so. The recogniser is told which words it may hear
// (src/voice/model.ts), so what arrives here is already a sentence in a closed vocabulary —
// "train three footmen", "storm bolt the enemy hero", "group two" — and turning a closed
// vocabulary into commands is a small grammar, not a model. A grammar is instant on the slowest
// machine, never invents an action the player did not say, and does the same thing every time;
// a language model would cost seconds per command on the PCs this has to run on.
//
// Kept pure (no DOM, no game): the NAMES it can match are handed in as a lexicon built from
// the game's own tables (src/voice/vocabulary.ts), and what comes out is a list of intents for
// the match to carry out through the very paths a click takes (render/mapViewer.ts). So the
// grammar can be pinned headlessly (tools/voice-parser-test.cjs).
//
// THE SENTENCE SHAPE is the one a player says out loud:
//
//     [verb] [count] [name] [preposition] [target]      "train 3 footmen", "attack the hero"
//     [name] [target]                                   "storm bolt that", "blizzard here"
//     … and … / … then …                                 several commands in one breath
//
// A sentence with no verb is a BUTTON's name — any button on the command card can be pressed
// by saying what it is called, which is what makes a map's custom abilities speakable without
// a line of code for them.
